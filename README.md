# Linux desktop environments wallpapers

This is a collection of hi-res wallpapers with desktop-environment brandings. Both the wallpapers and the logos are pulled out from official sources, with the intention of being aligned with the theme and branding of the desktop environment, instead of a particular distro as it is normally do. To achieve this I use images from the Deskop/Distribution own walpapers/backgrounds and official logos. Some logos needed the name added.

All wallpapers are property of their respective owners, and all logos are property of their respective trademark holders
